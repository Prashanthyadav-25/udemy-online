<h1>CSS </h1>

<p class="GFG">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
.</p>
<p class="GFG">When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process
.</p>
<p class="GFG">The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files..</p>
